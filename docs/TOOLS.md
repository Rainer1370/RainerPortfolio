# Tools for the Tools Section

## Completed Tools
- [x] **UTC, NTP, Unix Timestamp Converter**
  - **What it does:** Displays UTC, local time, and Unix timestamp in real time.
  - **Use Case:** Helps with time synchronization and understanding time standards.
  - **Enhancement Idea:** Add the ability to convert custom timestamps to local time and vice versa.

- [x] **Converter and 8b10b Encoder**
  - **What it does:** Converts numbers between multiple formats (base 10, hex, binary, etc.) and encodes binary values using the 8b10b standard.
  - **Use Case:** Useful for accelerator timing systems and general educational purposes.
  - **Enhancement Idea:** Add support for more encoding standards or expanded number ranges.

  - **Enhancement Idea:** Provide interactive visualizations of beam envelopes and phase space trajectories.

- [ ] **Frequency Spectrum/Waveform Visualizer**
  - **What it does:** Accepts input signals (e.g., sine, square, or custom) and displays their waveform and frequency spectrum.
  - **Use Case:** Ideal for physics, signal processing, and electrical engineering studies.
  - **Enhancement Idea:** Allow exporting graphs as images or adding real-time input analysis.

- [ ] **Temperature Converter**
  - **What it does:** Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
  - **Use Case:** Educational or practical for scientific and everyday calculations.
  - **Enhancement Idea:** Integrate live weather data for real-world applications and add a graph showing temperature trends.
