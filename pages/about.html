            <h2>Critical Systems Under My Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                As a Senior Technology Engineer, I am responsible for managing several critical systems integral to the smooth operation of NSLS-II:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utilities Systems:</strong> Ensuring the seamless operation of core utilities systems vital for accelerator and facility performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Vacuum Systems:</strong> Overseeing the vacuum systems which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of beamlines.</li>
                <li><strong>EPS (Equipment Protection System):</strong> Managing systems that safeguard both equipment and personnel in the facility.</li>
                <li><strong>PPS (Personnel Protection System):</strong> Overseeing security systems that ensure the safety of all personnel within NSLS-II.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing IOCs:</strong> Developing and maintaining systems for precise timing and synchronization of accelerator operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations IOCs and GUIs:</strong> Creating specialized IOCs tailored for operations use, along with Control System Studio (CSS) GUIs, to streamline operations and provide an intuitive interface for operators and system experts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These systems are essential for NSLS-IIâ€™s operation and I work to maintain their efficiency, reliability, and modernization.
