            <p>
                I am Rob Rainer, a Senior Technology Engineer with over 15 years of experience at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
                My expertise includes EPICS-based control systems, real-time diagnostics, and AI/ML integration.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Master of Science in Engineering, providing me with a strong foundation 
                in both theoretical principles and practical applications. This academic background has been instrumental in driving 
                my innovative contributions to accelerator operations and controls engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my technical contributions, I have mentored junior engineers and interns, fostering the next generation of professionals.

            <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in science and engineering spans diverse fields, from advanced materials research to leading-edge accelerator operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began as a Lab Supervisor at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, using advanced electron microscopy techniques 
                for my undergraduate thesis on materials characterization. After earning my Bachelor of Science in Physics in 2007, 
                I joined a Materials R&D lab, conducting research on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and photovoltaics to advance alternative energy technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, I transitioned to Brookhaven National Laboratory, starting at NSLS-I as an operations coordinator and accelerator operator. During this time, I earned my Master of Science in Engineering. At NSLS-I, I supported beamline operations and coordinated experiments. 
                With the commissioning of NSLS-II, I contributed to its *First Light* success by developing EPICS-based GUIs, commissioning the injector and storage ring, and establishing the operations center infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since joining the NSLS-II Accelerator Controls Group in 2020, I have taken ownership of critical accelerator systems. I have integrated modern cyber security practices, transitioned to a virtualization model, and applied AI/ML techniques to cutting-edge accelerator research. My system administration work ensures the reliability and optimization of NSLS-IIâ€™s critical infrastructure.
            </p>
