            <h2>Network Infrastructure Upgrades</h2>
            <p>
                The NSLS-II facility has transitioned to a virtualization model for its infrastructure. 
                This approach enables central deployment of tools and configurations, improving system efficiency. 
                Additionally, the virtualization model enhances cybersecurity by providing better control and protection over the system components.

            <h2>Beam Dump Recovery Tool</h2>
            <p>
                Automated recovery of the machine after a beam dump, ensuring key recovery steps (such as EPS reset and RF state switches) 
                are not overlooked, and the system is configured appropriately.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Injection Configuration Tool</h2>
            <p>
                Created a Python-based tool that interfaces with EPICS PVs to configure various injection types, simplifying the setup 
                and ensuring better consistency in operations.
