            <h2>NSLS-II Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>
                The NSLS-II facility has transitioned to a virtualization model for its infrastructure. This approach enables central deployment of tools and configurations, improving system efficiency. Additionally, the virtualization model enhances cybersecurity by providing better control and protection over the system components.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>AI-Assisted Accelerator Timing System:</strong> Achieved picosecond resolution, updated and optimized performance through AI-driven optimization techniques.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>EPICS-Based Area Radiation Monitor (ARM) Modernization</strong> - A two-fold initiative:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, updated the EPICS device driver to accommodate new hardware, using AI to optimize the refactoring process.</li>
                        <li>Second, modernized the way ARMs, which are part of the Personnel Protection System (PPS), transmit data streams over the network through network hardware and configuration upgrades, improving reliability and scalability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>SBM Top-Off Application:</strong> Enhanced machine efficiency by enabling uniform beam injection and implementing ML techniques for optimization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Nominal Gaps Application:</strong> Developed a centralized tool allowing operators to control all accelerator insertion devices simultaneously from one location, improving operational efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Beam Dump Recovery Tool:</strong> Automated recovery of the machine after a beam dump, ensuring key recovery steps (such as EPS reset and RF state switches) are not overlooked, and the system is configured appropriately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Injection Configuration Tool:</strong> Created a Python-based tool that interfaces with EPICS PVs to configure various injection types, simplifying the setup and ensuring better consistency in operations.
                </li>
            </ul>
