            <h2>Network Infrastructure Upgrades</h2>
            <p>
                The NSLS-II facility has transitioned to a virtualization model for its infrastructure. 
                This approach enables central deployment of tools and configurations, improving system efficiency. 
                Additionally, the virtualization model enhances cybersecurity by providing better control and protection over the system components.

            <h2>Systems-Focused Test Benches</h2>
            <p>
                Designed and implemented test bench environments that replicate production configurations, ensuring seamless live spare availability and facilitating development work in a controlled, isolated setting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These test benches have been instrumental in supporting groups like Vacuum, RF, and Diagnostics, allowing them to test upgrades, troubleshoot issues, and validate tools without affecting the live production environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By creating these environments, I established a standard framework adopted across multiple teams, improving efficiency and reliability while minimizing risks to production systems.

            <h2>SBM Top-Off Application</h2>
            <p>
                Enhanced machine efficiency by enabling uniform beam injection and implementing ML techniques for optimization.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="project">
            <h2>Nominal Gaps Application</h2>
            <p>
                Developed a centralized tool allowing operators to control all accelerator insertion devices simultaneously from one location, 
                improving operational efficiency.

            <h2>Beam Dump Recovery Tool</h2>
            <p>
                Automated recovery of the machine after a beam dump, ensuring key recovery steps (such as EPS reset and RF state switches) 
                are not overlooked, and the system is configured appropriately.
            </p>

            <h2>Injection Configuration Tool</h2>
            <p>
                Created a Python-based tool that interfaces with EPICS PVs to configure various injection types, simplifying the setup 
                and ensuring better consistency in operations.
